# PRD: Organization-User Messaging Chat Flow

## Overview

Implement a real-time messaging chat flow between an organization and its users. Each user can chat with their organization (e.g., with an admin or automated assistant). Messages are stored in the database and can leverage Vercel's AI SDK for streaming responses.

## Tasks

### 1. Database & Backend

#### 1.1. Update Prisma Schema

- [x] Run `prisma migrate` to apply schema changes.

#### 1.2. Messaging API

- [ ] Create a new API route for sending and retrieving messages between a user and their organization.
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization for message access.
- [ ] Add pagination and filtering for message history.

#### 1.3. AI Streaming Route

- [ ] Create a new streaming API route using Vercel's AI SDK for organization-user chat.
- [ ] Integrate the route to handle real-time message streaming and AI responses.

### 2. Frontend
